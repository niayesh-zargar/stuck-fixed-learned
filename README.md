This project began as a simple exercise to get more comfortable with Python functions.
My goals were straightforward:

Define variables inside the function

Use return to send results back

Print formatted messages showing both inputs and outputs clearly

What seemed easy at first turned into a challenge when I added these specific conditions.
Along the way, I dived into new concepts like decorators to achieve my goals without breaking the rules I set for myself.

This little journey taught me a lot about writing cleaner, more effective Python code.

Feel free to explore the code and share your feedback!
